This repository contains code for the .NET version of the [Microsoft Bot Builder SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder). The Bot Builder SDK v4 is the latest SDK for building bot applications.  

In addition to the .NET SDK, Bot Builder supports creating bots in other popular programming languages like [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js), [Python (Preview)](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python), and [Java (Preview)](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java).

To get started see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) for the v4 SDK.

A rich set of samples are available at [BotBuilder-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples) repository.
