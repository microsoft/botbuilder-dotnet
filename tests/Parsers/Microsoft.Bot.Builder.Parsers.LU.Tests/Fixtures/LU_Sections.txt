# Greeting

> ML ENTITY. Without an explicit entity definition, 'userName' defaults to 'ml' entity type.
# getUserName
- my name is {username=vishwac}

> PREBUILT ENTITIES
@ prebuilt number numOfGuests, age

> COMPOSITE ENTITIES
# setThermostat
> This utterance labels ‘thermostat to 72’ as composite entity deviceTemperature
    - Please set {deviceTemperature = thermostat to 72}
> This is an example utterance that labels ‘owen’ as customDevice (ml entity) and wraps ‘owen to 72’ with the ‘deviceTemperature’ composite entity
    - Set {deviceTemperature = {customDevice = owen} to 72}

> Define a composite entity ‘deviceTemperature’ that has device (list entity), customDevice (ml entity), temperature (pre-built entity) as children

> In patterns, you can use roles using the {\<entityName\>:\<roleName\>} notation
# getUserNameRoles
- call me {name:userName}
- I'm {name:userName}
- my name is {name:userName}

> roles can be specified for list entity types as well - in this case fromCity and toCity are added as roles to the 'city' list entity defined further below
