> You can use roles in patterns using the entityName:role notation.
# getUserName
- call me {name:userName}
- I'm {name:userName}
- my name is {name:userName}

# getUserFirstName
> this is another role for the same 'name' entity
- [[my] first name is] {name:userFirstName}

# BookFlight
> roles can be specified for list entity types as well - in this case fromCity and toCity are added as roles to the 'city' list entity defined further below
- book flight from {city:fromCity} to {city:toCity}
- [can you] get me a flight from {city:fromCity} to {city:toCity}
- get me a flight to {city:toCity}
- I need to fly from {city:fromCity}

$city:Seattle=
- Seattle
- Tacoma
- SeaTac

$city:Portland=

# setAlarm
> prebuilt entitities can have roles as well.
- create alarm for {datetimeV2:startTime}

# deleteAlarm
- remove the {datetimeV2:deleteTime} alarm

> This is just defining datetimeV2 as a prebuilt entity type. If an explicit type is not specified, by default entities in patterns will be set to pattern.any entity type
